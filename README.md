# Introduction

This package aims to provide an easy and flexible way to explore the visualization of data based on Mapper, a topological data analysis method, It provides users with extensive tools to customize the visualization, optimally select filter functions and evaluate the results from Mapper.

To install the latest version of this R package directly from github:
```
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("TianshuFeng/STA")
```

# Usage
Detailed instructions can be found in the [vignette](https://tianshufeng.github.io/STA/articles/STA.html). The vignette includes example codes to simulate the chicken foot data and to generate the network graph with the STA method. Examples of how to select filter functions and to custom and evaluate the generated networks are also provided.
