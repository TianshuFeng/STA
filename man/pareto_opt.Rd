\title{Find the pareto frontier}
\usage{
pareto_opt(res_filter, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{res_filter}{The data.frame of Shannon indices and spread measures under
different filter functions. The first column must be names of filter
functions, and the second and third columns should be the shannon indices
and spread measures.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments for \code{\link[rPref]{psel}}.}
}
\value{
A data.frame of the names of filter functions in the pareto frontier,
  as well as their Shannon indices and spread measures.
}
\description{
\code{pareto_opt} finds the pareto frontier of filter functions based on
Shannon indices and spread measures with function \code{\link[rPref]{psel}}
from R package `rPref`.
